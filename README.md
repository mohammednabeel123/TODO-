# Simple Todo List Web App

This is a basic but fully functional Todo List application built with HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), and JavaScript.

### What it does:

* **Shows the current time and date**, updating every second at the top of the page.
* Lets you **add new tasks** by typing into the input box and pressing Enter.
* Each task you add shows:

  * An **empty circle icon** to mark the task as done.
  * A **trash icon** to delete the task.
* When you click the circle, it toggles to a **green checked circle** and the task text gets a **strikethrough** — showing the task is completed.
* Click the trash icon to **remove** a task.
* A **Reset button** reloads the page and clears all tasks.

### Why this project?

It’s a simple exercise to practice:

* Working with the **DOM** in JavaScript: adding, removing, and modifying elements dynamically.
* Using **event listeners** to interact with user input.
* Manipulating CSS classes to change styles and icons.
* Displaying live **time and date** updates.
* Integrating **Bootstrap** and **Font Awesome** for quick and clean UI design.

### How to use:

* Open the webpage in a modern browser.
* Add tasks by typing and pressing Enter.
* Mark tasks done by clicking the circle icon.
* Delete tasks by clicking the trash icon.
* Reset the list by clicking the Reset button.
